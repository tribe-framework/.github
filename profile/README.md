# Tribe Framework

Tribe is our collaborative tech framework designed for rapid, scalable development. We build apps architected to handle millions of users from launch.

## How It Works

Our framework consists of three core components working together:

35 Integrated Repositories - Our complete development ecosystem, available at https://github.com/tribe-framework. Each repository serves a specific function, from UI components to deployment tools, all designed to work seamlessly together.

Junction - Our no-code backend service, developed by us and refined over 7 years. This PHP-based platform automatically deploys as independent Docker containers, handling everything from database management to API generation without manual configuration. The cloud version of Junction can be accessed from https://junction.express and the open source version from https://github.com/tribe-framework/junction.

Ember - Our frontend stack of choice, that we integrate with Tribe to create complete web applications. We also provide native wrappers for iOS, Android, and desktop deployment. To learn more about EmberJS visit https://emberjs.com. To use Tribe within Ember head to https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-tribe.

## Built for Change

Tribe evolves continuously with the technology landscape. As new frameworks, tools, and best practices emerge, we update our repositories to incorporate the latest advances while maintaining compatibility across all components. We have a proven track record of maintaining 100% backward compatibility since our inception in Nov 2017.

This living framework allows us to build production-ready applications that scale immediately while dramatically reducing development time.
